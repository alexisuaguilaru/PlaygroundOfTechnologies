## Brief
Introductory experiment to the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) environment with the objective of exploring the fundamentals: Tensor, DataLoaders, Layers, Optimizer and how to build a Neural Network (Model).

## Comment
First, the documentation [PyTorch: Learn the Basics](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html) was consulted, on which this experiment was completely based and in which the basic concepts for creating a model using PyTorch and its training (DataLoaders, Loss Functions and Optimizers) are sufficiently explained.

The following dataset [Extrovert vs. Introvert Behavior Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakeshkapilavai/extrovert-vs-introvert-behavior-data) was used to build a binary classification model. The code is present in [01_Fundamentals](./01_Fundamentals.py) as an interactive notebook of [Marimo](https://marimo.io/).

## Results
Performing this mini practice, one was able to understand the basics of PyTorch operation as a brief introduction to this library for building Neural Network models. All the acquired learning is exposed in the created notebook.
