# Calling C From Python

In this set of experiments attempts to understand how to create Python modules or libraries from C/C++, that is, to create functions, types and classes in C/C++ to be imported or called as Python objects. This is done in order to understand how Python is used as an interface in embedded systems or in programs/systems where higher precision or processing speed is required.
